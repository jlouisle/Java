/*
Write a class Duck with methods quack, swim and how.
Define subclasses WildDuck and TameDuck, who both redefine
the show method. Write neccesary methods for debugging and 
'programming best practices'.
Write a class DuckTest to show the results of some testing.
Add a method fly. Adapt the tests.
Write a new class RubberDuck. Of course this one can be shown
as well, and it does quack. Then write a new class WoodenDucj,
inheriting from Duck, but who cannot quack. In all cases, adapt
the test methods.*/
